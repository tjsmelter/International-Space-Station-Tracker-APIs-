# ISS Tracker

This project uses API data to track the movement of the ISS and the sunset times for a given set of coordinates. If the satellite flies within a certain radius of the user, an email is sent to prompt the recipient to go outside and look for the ISS passing overhead.

Program utitlizes several tools, such as API calls, parsing JSON data, and automating emails with the SMTP module.
