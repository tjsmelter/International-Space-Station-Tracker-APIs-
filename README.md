# ISS Tracker

This project uses API data to track the movement of the ISS and the sunset times for a given set of coordinates. Then, if it is detected to be nearby, an email is sent to prompt the recipient to go outside and look for the ISS passing overhead.
While writing this program, I was able to utitlize several tools, such as API calls, parsing JSON data, and automating emails with SMTP module.
